# What is this?
This is a security tool where new computer logins will be logged to a Discord webhook where the public IP address, IPv4, IPv6, geolocation, and basic computer information are logged.

## Why?
Why not :)

# Installation
Add your Discord webhook URL to `webhook_url` in main.rs, then build the project and add it to your STARTUP directory. After that, you're done!
